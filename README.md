# squarescript-ide
A HTML based coding language. It's the easiest coding language I think...


To start using the site you can local host it by downloading the files as zip, extracting it and double clicking the file inside, a new page will open with your local squarescript ide!
Another way you can do that is by finding it cloud hosted in tiiny.site here [squarescript.tiiny.site ](https://squarescript.tiiny.site/)
